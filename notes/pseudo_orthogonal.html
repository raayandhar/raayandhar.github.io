    <h2>Pseudo-Orthogonal Matrices</h2>
    <p> 
      Prof. Vandenberghe has a great set of <a href="https://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/133A/133A-exercises.pdf">additional exercies</a> where I ran across the idea of an <i>pseudo-orthogonal</i> matrix, defined as follows. He first defines a <i>signature matrix</i>, a square matrix with diagonal elements are either \(+1\) or \(-1\). Then if \(S\) is a signature matrix, and \(A\) is a square matrix that satisfies:
      $$
      A^TSA = S
      $$
    then we say that \(A\) is <i>pseudo-orthogonal</i> with respect to \(S\). The exercise I'm referencing is exercise 6.11.
    <h3>(a)</h3>
     To show that 
    $$
    A = S - \frac{2}{u^TSu} uu^T
    $$
is pseudo-orthogonal, we have the following:
    $$ 
    \begin{aligned}
A^TSA &= \left(S - \frac{2}{u^TSu}uu^T \right)^T S \left(S - \frac{2}{u^TSu}uu^T\right) \\
&= \left(S^T - \frac{2}{u^TSu}uu^T \right) S \left(S - \frac{2}{u^TSu}uu^T \right) \ \text{(distributing transpose)} \\
&= \left(I - \frac{2}{u^TSu} uu^TS\right)\left(S - \frac{2}{u^TSu}uu^T\right) \ \text{(note: \(SS = I\))} \\
&= S - \frac{2}{u^TSu} uu^T - \frac{2}{u^T S u} S uu^T S + \frac{4}{(u^TSu)^2} u(u^TSu)u^T \ \text{(distributing)} \\
&= S - \frac{4}{u^TSu} uu^T + \frac{4}{u^TSu} uu^T \text{(since \(S\) is diagonal, can be moved anywhere as an operation)} \\
&= S
\end{aligned}
    $$
    as desired.
